\subsection{Moving reference frames}

This section is dedicated to saying that ``If Newton's laws are valid in one reference frame, they are also valid in any second frames that moves with \textbf{constant velocity relative to the first}"

The bolden text signifies that if the coordinate system was \textit{accelerating}, Newton's laws falls apart

\begin{rmk}
    In classical physics, the unaccelerated frames in which Newton's laws hold (including the law of inertia??) are often called \textbf{inertial frames}.

    By this remark and by bolden text above, we can say that an accelerated frame is \textbf{noninterntial} because Newton's laws doesn't work in accelerated frames.
