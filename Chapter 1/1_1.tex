\subsection{Relativity}
\textbf{Relativity of measurements}: Measurement requires the specification of a reference system relative to which the measurement is to be made.

Einstein's theory of relativity is actually two theories.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Special theory of relativity (excluding unaccelerated frames of reference and gravity): \textbf{Put most effort} into this one
    \item General theory of relativity (including the mentioned things)
\end{itemize}
