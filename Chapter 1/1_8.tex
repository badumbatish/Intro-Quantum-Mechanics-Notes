\subsection{The relativity of Time; Time Dilation}
Readers are encouraged to  read the book for the experiment and derivation of the following formulas. In this section, we only mention the formulas, a way to approach a problem and explain the \textbf{proper time} and the \textbf{unique inertia frame}.

\subsubsection{Formulas}

Let $v$ be the speed of a frame $S$, and $c$ be the speed of light. The ratio between $v$ and $c$ is $\beta$
\begin{align*}
    v &= \beta c \\ \\
    \beta &= \frac{v}{c}
\end{align*}

Then the symbol $\gamma$ expressing the ratio between $\Delta t$ and $\Delta t_0$:
\begin{align*}
    \gamma &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}} \\\\
     \Delta t &= \gamma \Delta t_0
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Proper time}

The definition of proper time can be a little loose
