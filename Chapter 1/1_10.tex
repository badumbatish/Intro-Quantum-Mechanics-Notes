\subsection{Length contraction}

The equation for length contraction is
\begin{align*}
    l = \frac{l_o}{\gamma} \leq l_o
\end{align*}
where the subscript 0 indicates that $l_0$ is the length of an object measured in its \textit{rest frame}, while $l$ refers to the length measured in \textit{any} frame. The length $l_0$ can be called the object's \textbf{proper length}.

The above equation is often called \textbf{length contraction} (or Lorentz contraction, or Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction)

\begin{remark}
    A moving object is observed to be contracted
