\subsubsection{First posulate of relativity}
\begin{quote}
    If $S$ is an inertial frame and if a second frame $S'$ moves with constant velocity relative to $S$, then $S'$ is also an inertial frame.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Second postulate of relativity}
\begin{quote}
    In all inertial frames, light travels through the vacuum with the same speed, $c = 299,792,458 $ m/s in any direction
