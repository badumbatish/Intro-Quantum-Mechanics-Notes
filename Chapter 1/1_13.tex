\subsection{The Velocity -Addition Formula}

The derivation comes from the fact that velocity is the differential of distance over the differential of time (or velocity is the derivative of distance) after that, it is basically substitution.

Then 
\begin{align*}
    u_{x}' &= \frac{u_x}{1- u_{x} \frac{v}{c^2}} \\
    u_{y}' &= \frac{u_y}{\gamma(1 -u_{x} \frac{v}{c^2})} \\
     u_{z}' &= \frac{u_z}{\gamma(1 -u_{x} \frac{v}{c^2})}
\end{align*}

where \textbf{$v$} is the velocity of $S'$ relative to $S$. 

The \textbf{Inverse Lorentz Transformation} can be achieved by exchanging primed and unprimed variables and replacing $v$ by $-v$.
